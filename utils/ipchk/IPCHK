Keep daemon targets:

  1. Start process
  1. Monitor process life
  2. Restart process if it's down

Has two operational modes

  >> Daemon mode (-d switch with non-zero value)
    runing continuously with delay between checks,
    also monitor SIGCHLDs (allows immediate restarts)

  >> Cron mode
    check processes (from pid-files), restart if need
    (store new pids), and immediatelly exit.
    Supposed to be periodicaly run from cron table.
    
  In daemon mode you can, also, direct keepd to 
  >> kill keeped processes, in own termination (-k switch)
  >> store own pid-file (-p)
